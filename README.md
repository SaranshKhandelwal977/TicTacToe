## Project Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game brings the classic two-player game to life using web technologies. The main features of the game include:

1. **Current Player Indicator**: The game displays the current player's name on top to indicate whose turn it is.

2. **Winner Announcement**: If a player wins, their name is displayed on top to announce the winner.

3. **Tie Notification**: If the game ends in a tie, the text changes to "Game Tied" on top.

4. **New Game Button**: A "New Game" button appears when a player wins or when the game ties. Clicking this button starts a new game.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start playing the Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

2. Players can take turns by clicking on empty cells to place their respective symbols (X or O).

3. The game will automatically detect and announce the winner or a tie. The winner's name or "Game Tied" text will be displayed on top.

4. If there's a winner or a tie, a "New Game" button will appear. Clicking this button will reset the game for a new round.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) in empty cells.
- The first player to achieve a winning pattern (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
